# Brazilian Historical Election Returns 

This repository collects electoral data from Brazil that are not readily
available from official sources like the [*Tribunal Superior
Eleitoral*](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais-1/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais)
or sites like the excellent [CEPESPE Data](http://cepespdata.io/) site. 
Currently, the data mostly comes from the authoritarian period (1964-1985).

I try, when possible, to include the original documents from which the data is drawn. These are typically scanned PDFs. 

Generally, municipal (IBGE) identifier codes are included and obvious errors are corrected when possible. If you find any additional errors in the data, please contact me at dhidalgo@mit.edu.
